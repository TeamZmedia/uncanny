        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to **Uncanny**, a multiplayer horror survival game like no other. Set in the mysterious town of **Hawthorn Hills**, North Carolina, players must survive the relentless pursuit of monstrous entities known as "The Senses". Each sense is embodied by a unique monster: one for vision, one for hearing, one for smell, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game is currently in development, and we are dedicated to delivering an immersive and horrifying experience. Whether you're exploring alone or with friends, you'll need to outsmart and evade the terrifying monsters while uncovering the secrets of this cursed town.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Unique Features**:
            <ul>
                <li>Multiplayer voice chat system integrated with the gameplay, where your voice can alert enemies like **Auditus** (the monster of sound).</li>
                <li>Daytime hunting by **The Senses** – five distinct monsters each designed around a human sense.</li>
                <li>Nighttime threats are different – the dangerous **Shadows** are attracted to light, forcing you to balance survival strategies.</li>
                <li>Immersive environment based on a real suburban town with a disturbing history of paranormal occurrences.</li>
                <li>Deep lore with hidden clues both in-game and on this website for players to uncover and theorize about.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to create not just a horror game but a community-driven investigation into the eerie history of **Hawthorn Hills**. The more you play, the more you’ll discover.

        <h2>The Senses</h2>
        <p>
            During the day, you will be hunted by **The Senses**, five monsters each corresponding to one of the five senses. Here’s a deeper look at each:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Vigilus (Vision)</b>: This monster has exceptional sight. It patrols wide areas and can spot you from a distance. But if you stay still in his sight, he cannot see you</li>
            <li><b>Auditus (Hearing)</b>: Auditus has superhuman hearing and can detect your movements, as well as your voice if you speak too loudly in voice chat. Be silent, or risk being caught.</li>
            <li><b>Olfacio (Smell)</b>: Olfacio tracks players by scent. It can sense your presence if you’ve lingered too long in one area. Hide your scent by using the environment to your advantage.</li>
            <li><b>Tactus (Touch)</b>: Tactus is blind but can feel the vibrations of movement. It reacts to physical disturbances like footsteps or opening doors. Stay still and be cautious when interacting with objects.</li>
            <li><b>Gustus (Taste)</b>: Gustus detects your presence by consumables, if you have 2-3 consumable items in your inventory, then he will know your general direction, but if most is food items, he will know where you are exactly</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Uncanny Lore</h2>
        <p>
            The town of **Hawthorn Hills** has always been a place shrouded in mystery. Founded in the early 1900s, strange disappearances and unsolved crimes became part of its dark legacy. Reports of paranormal activity started in the 1950s, when a local man claimed to have seen shadowy figures stalking the woods at dusk.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 1970s, more disappearances occurred, leading many to believe the town was cursed. Several residents even reported seeing monstrous figures roaming the streets, though authorities dismissed these claims as hysteria.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hidden clues about the town’s past and the origin of **The Senses** can be found both in-game and on this website. Pay close attention to small details and you might uncover secrets that connect the dots between the horrific events of the past and the monsters that haunt the town today.
